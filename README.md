# AI and Compute (2022)

This repository contains one Jupyter notebook containing all of the code used to support the conclusions of Andrew Lohn and Micah Musser, "AI and Compute: How Much Longer Can Computing Power Drive Artificial Intelligence Progress?" (Center for Security and Emerging Technology: January 2022). 

Please note that most of the data for this project was provided to us by a researcher at OpenAI who contributed to Dario Amodei et al., "AI and Compute," OpenAI Blog, May 16, 2018, https://openai.com/blog/ai-and-compute/. We have redacted the data provided to us by OpenAI, which means that a fair bit of this code is non-functional. However, in the interests of transparency, we are at least providing the code itself so that interested readers can follow our chain of logic.
